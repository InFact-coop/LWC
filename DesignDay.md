## Idea as a messaging service :iphone: 
* __Triage__ 
    * Listening to the user before recommending solutions 
    * Giving follow up details and info about cancelling apt. 
    * calendly 
    * Empathy!
    * Support on hand to help with small tasks e.g. forms, calling energy suppliers 
    * There are some common threads that people call up - can there be drafted scripts for these? (jobs, debt, death, confidence issues etc) 
* __Logging information__ 
    * Not everyone records info after 1st call
    * Need to uncover "hidden" needs that can only be found with human contact 
    * Not enough human power to analyse data. 
    * Want to capture data from walk ins 
    * Want to know people's details 
        * Allow for ease of positive recommendations
    *    Currently no short way of logging details up front 
            * You have to ask quite personal questions which may not be appropriate but without asking you cannot log details 
            * Requires org discussion to change this as has implications  
* __Data analytics__
    * Be able to show specific data dependent on what is needed 
*  __Peer support__ 
    *  Face to face and phone call option to discuss how to become a peer support worker 
 
## Storyboards :art: 
* option to go through to call _*or*_ fill in questions online
    * Could be less scary than walking through the door 
    * practicalities not realistic? 
    * But it could bring consistencies 
    * Could be an ipad at reception desk? 
        * Could be helped by reception to fill in
* Want to have a google analytics style system for walk in data 
    * To find out why people are/aren't engaging, what days are busy etc
* Personas that people can relate to. They can have quotes and the user can say if they feel the same 
    * Shows more detail on click - & shows services available to help. 
* Summary & appointments screen summarising info (done with hairdressing apps :haircut:) 
* _*"Welcome to a better future"*_
* Calendar to choose apt. date
* Area for a returning user who would like to sign up for volunteering/mentoring/donating 

## Comments :pencil2: 
* __Online peer support group__
* First point of contact v important to create trust - not all staff feel able to help because of variety of skills.
    * Need to make sure they come in to the right person
    * Need a triage person ? 
    * Currently no script etc. to discover the person's needs 
* Internal vs External 
* Needs to be a real person on first point of contact?
    * Peer support system 
    * _*everyone*_ should be able to answer the phone confidentally 
* What should be automated? 
    * Can there be a triage system to direct user to the correct person?
* Some people are holding a lot of information in their head! Needs to get written somewhere
* Used to be a volunteer handbook
* Need to stop tyring to fit people into what we currently have. For example mind fit doesn't suit everyone - if we have the data then we could improve the offer that's available.
* Need for engagement staff?
* Currently not capacity to do 121 with everyone
* Is their a need to upskill mentors and volunteers? 
* Possibility to try something new as an org. 
* No user interviews done to find out about women moving from service to service
    * there has been interviews about why people first contact LWC
