# Airtable guide for LWC

![airtable1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438558-e2371dd0-028e-11e8-9c96-97d02d1e0f6a.gif)

Above you can see an animation of the airtable spreadsheet. You can use the `filter` button at the top to filter by each of the columns, as demonstrated. You can add or remove as many filters as you like.

![airtable2 - group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438557-e219fb88-028e-11e8-942c-667cc0ccbb35.gif)

You can also `group` the spreadsheet by different columns. This might make it easier to see each individual record per Area of interest, for example. Again, you can group as many times as you like.

![airtable2 - sort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438556-e20009d0-028e-11e8-88d3-acb5a4c8042c.gif)

You can also `sort` by columns. Above you can see the spreadsheet sorted by area of interest, and then by postcode as a secondary sort.

![airtable2 - export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438553-e1b55610-028e-11e8-9380-43a2b17104e8.gif)

You can export you data from Airtable into CSV values, like in the animation above.

![airtable2 - print](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438552-e19bfa94-028e-11e8-9278-f55ac52989a6.gif)

Or else you can print the table :point_up:

![airtable2 - testimonials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438551-e184a3d0-028e-11e8-9888-d1a83ce0fcb2.gif)

Above you can see the Testimonials tab. By double clicking on a field, you can edit the information in it. **We strongly advise not to change the final _Image source_ field**. You can also expand the field for easier editing/viewing.

If you change something on here, and something goes a bit wrong connecting to the website, the website will just default to the original testimonials.

![airtable2 - testimonials-views](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438550-e16d181e-028e-11e8-9bc0-948b9f9b20a5.gif)

Again, you can change the view to `Gallery` which serves this information quite well. You can also edit the fields from this view as well.

![airtable2 - testimonials-cards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23310908/35438549-e1534a4c-028e-11e8-8198-e5a016b06b34.gif)

In this view you can also customise how each of the `cards` look, to give more or less detail.
