## The Challenge :two_women_holding_hands: 

LWC face a complexity of the challenges including:
 - the complex emotions of **stigma** and **fear of judgement** attached to seeking help with services
 - Women feeling they are **wasting people's time** by seeking help with LWC
 - Differing experiences for users based on **who answers the phone**
- The need to make sure that users are getting the services that are **right for them**
 - How to use the LWC **peer support group** to its fullest extent?
 - The lack of **data** to help guide users journeys through the cente and direct LWCs services. 

We focused our solution on __helping women to discover the services on offer in a safe and relatable way__.
